# Hello, world!

Hi. It’s been a while since I’ve talked to the vast Internet. I have done a huge renewal to my personal website, including changes such as employing a new framework, following the most recent trend, putting a new profile picture (although the picture itself is back when I was in high school!), and adding a project tab, which would include some big projects that I have done in the past (I’ll add more to this later on). I’m very excited to share my interests and projects that I have done so far, and I will keep on sharing the most recent news in several areas in the CS area. 

But first, let’s talk about some updates that I have done to this brand new website. My old website was a simple HTML + CSS + JS website that utilized a template that I bought for probably \$20, and I changed some content according to my taste and hosted the files on Github Pages, which did not take me long to set it up. I bought the domain for about \$10 on NameCheap (which is an awesome place selling domain names, so definitely check them out), and set up my very first website. This was when I was back in high school, so probably 5 years or so before. I have done a massive research on web development and its related areas, and I figured out that the old website has a lot of room for improvement for the last five years. I knew that I should have made some changes to make the website look better, but I was too lazy and did not care more about it. But finally, I’m here! I have made some changes that improve not only the website’s design but also its mechanical features.

The biggest change that I made is that I changed the website’s simple HTML + CSS + JS structure into using a fancy framework, and it’s no other than Next.js. React is the most renowned front-end library in the industry, and Vercel did an amazing job creating a convenient and visually appealing framework out of it. I get some people’s hatred against those big-tech frameworks, but honestly, for creating a simple website like this, frameworks are so useful with their tools and necessities already brought to use. Because of the character of the website, I was considering using Django at first, but it became too much of a hassle trying to use Python in a web development area. I just can’t get over it. Javascript (or Typescript) makes so much more sense around here.  

I might make some more updates to the website to my taste, and the first thing I would do is to self-host the files. I’m currently using Vercel’s hosting services since they have the highest compatibility to Next.js framework. However, if I were to use a different framework or a library, I would perhaps self-host the files since I just don’t like putting my personal data to some company’s cloud (this has made me avoid big-tech cloud services, like AWS). I’m currently leaning towards using Ruby on Rails, which I heard has great compatibility with self-hosting a website using their framework. There is a learning curve because I have no knowledge about Ruby, the language, so I should invest some time in it. Scaling would also be an issue when I self-host my website, so I would have to come up with a solution for that problem as well.
